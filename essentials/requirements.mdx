## Requirements Generation

Test Companion allows you to create structured requirements using either text input or voice recording, with AI-powered priority assignment.

### Input Methods

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Type Requirements" icon="keyboard">
    Enter requirements directly using the text input field
  </Card>

  <Card title="Voice Recording" icon="microphone">
    Speak your requirements naturally for automatic conversion
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating Requirements

### Text Input Method

1. Select the "Type" option
2. Enter your requirements in natural language
3. Click "Process Text" to generate structured requirements

### Voice Recording Method

1. Select the "Voice" option
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Speak your requirements naturally
4. Recording will automatically process when you finish

<Note>
  Use natural language to describe your requirements. The AI will structure them
  and assign appropriate priority levels.
</Note>

## Example Format

Here's an example of how to phrase your requirements:

```text
"The system should allow users to log in with their email and password with high priority.
Users should also be able to reset their password through email verification with medium priority."
```

## Requirements Preview

After processing, requirements are displayed with:

- Clear, structured statements
- Automatically assigned priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Draft status indicators
- Delete options for each requirement

### Priority Levels

Requirements are automatically categorized with priority tags:

- High Priority - Critical functionality
- Medium Priority - Important features
- Low Priority - Nice-to-have features

## Managing Requirements

### Adding Requirements

1. Review the generated requirements in the preview section
2. Remove any unwanted requirements using the delete (Ã—) button
3. Click "Add Requirements" to save the approved requirements

### Editing Requirements

- Each requirement can be:
  - Deleted individually
  - Modified before final addition
  - Re-processed if needed

<Warning>
  Deleted requirements cannot be recovered. Make sure to review carefully before
  removing.
</Warning>

## Integration with Test Cases

Requirements can be used to:

- Guide test case generation
- Provide context for bug reports
- Track testing coverage
- Prioritize testing efforts

<Tip>
  Use specific, actionable language when describing requirements to get better
  structured results and more accurate priority assignments.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Requirements**

   - Use specific, measurable terms
   - Include expected behavior
   - Specify conditions and constraints

2. **Voice Recording**

   - Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
   - Use complete sentences
   - Include priority indicators in your speech

3. **Review Process**
   - Verify priority assignments
   - Check for completeness
   - Ensure requirements are testable

## Example Requirements

Here are some well-structured requirements:

```text
The system must ensure that passwords are encrypted and not stored in plain text.

After a successful login, the system must maintain the user's session until they log out
or the session expires after a defined period of inactivity.

The system must lock an account after 5 consecutive failed login attempts and provide
instructions to reset the password.
```

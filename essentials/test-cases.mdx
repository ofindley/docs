## Generating Test Cases

Transform your recorded web interactions into structured test cases with just a few clicks.

### Prerequisites

- Test Companion browser extension installed
- At least one recorded web interaction
- Active Test Companion account

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Record Your Interaction

Use the Test Companion browser extension to record your web interaction:

- Click the extension icon in your browser
- Start recording
- Perform the actions you want to test
- Stop recording when finished

#### 2. Access Recorded Steps

- Navigate to your Test Companion dashboard
- Select the "Recordings" section
- Find and click on your desired recording

#### 3. Generate Test Cases

- Locate the "Generate New Test Cases" button at the top of the recording page
- Click to initiate the AI-powered test case generation
- Wait while our system analyzes your recording and creates structured test cases

<Note>
  The generation process typically takes 1-2 minutes, depending on the
  complexity of your recording.
</Note>

#### 4. Review Generated Cases

Once generation is complete, you'll be automatically redirected to the test cases page where you can:

- View all generated test cases in a list format
- Review test steps and expected outcomes
- Check preconditions and requirements

### Managing Test Cases

<Tip>
  You can generate multiple sets of test cases from the same recording to cover
  different testing scenarios and edge cases.

## Project Management

Projects help you organize your testing workflow by grouping related recordings, test cases, and bug reports together.

### Creating a Project

1. Click the "New Project" button in the top-right corner
2. Enter project details:
   - Project name
   - Description (optional)
   - Created date (automatically set)
3. Click "Save Changes" to create the project

<Note>
  Projects help you organize testing efforts for different applications,
  features, or teams.
</Note>

## Project Dashboard

Each project displays key metrics at a glance:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Recordings" icon="video">
    Number of recorded test sessions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Test Case Batches" icon="flask">
    Generated test case collections
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bug Reports" icon="bug">
    Documented issues and bugs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Project Settings

### Recording Key

Generate a project-specific recording key to automatically assign recordings:

1. Navigate to project settings
2. Find the "Recording Key" section
3. Options:
   - **Copy**: Copy the current key
   - **Regenerate**: Create a new key
   - **Clear**: Remove the existing key

<Warning>
  Regenerating a key will invalidate the previous key. Update your browser
  extension with the new key to continue recording.
</Warning>

### Project Status

Projects can be in one of two states:

- **Active**: Visible in dashboard and available for new recordings
- **Archived**: Hidden from main view but preserved for reference

To change status:

1. Go to project settings
2. Click "Archive Project" to archive
3. Archived projects can be reactivated from the projects list

### Project Management Options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Edit Project" icon="pen-to-square">
    - Modify project name - Update description - Change project settings
  </Card>

  <Card title="Delete Project" icon="trash" color="red">
    Permanently remove project and all associated data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  Deleting a project will permanently remove all associated recordings, test
  cases, and bug reports. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Project Organization

### Viewing Projects

- Active projects appear in your main dashboard
- Use "View All Projects" to see both active and archived projects
- Click on a project to view its details and contents

### Project Contents

Each project contains:

1. **Recordings**

   - Captured test sessions
   - Automatically tagged with metadata
   - Organized by date and time

2. **Test Case Batches**

   - Generated test cases from recordings
   - Grouped by generation batch
   - Linked to source recordings

3. **Bug Reports**
   - Documented issues
   - Associated with recordings
   - Tracked with status and priority

<Tip>
  Use tags to further organize recordings within a project. Tags can help
  categorize by feature, component, or test type.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. **Project Structure**

   - Create separate projects for different applications or major features
   - Use clear, descriptive project names
   - Add detailed project descriptions

2. **Recording Management**

   - Use project-specific recording keys
   - Tag recordings appropriately
   - Keep related recordings in the same project

3. **Project Maintenance**
   - Archive completed or inactive projects
   - Regularly review and clean up unused recordings
   - Maintain project documentation

## Creating Bug Reports

Generate detailed bug reports from your recorded interactions with AI assistance.

### Prerequisites

- Test Companion browser extension installed
- At least one recorded web interaction
- Active Test Companion account

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Record Your Interaction

Use the Test Companion browser extension to capture the bug:

- Click the extension icon in your browser
- Start recording
- Reproduce the steps that demonstrate the bug
- Stop recording when finished

#### 2. Access Recorded Steps

- Navigate to your Test Companion dashboard
- Select the "Recordings" section
- Locate and open the recording containing the bug

#### 3. Initiate Bug Report

- Click the "Report Bug" button at the top of the recording page
- You'll be automatically directed to the bug report creation page

#### 4. Describe the Bug

Two ways to provide bug details:

- **Type**: Enter the bug description directly in the text editor
- **Voice**: Use the voice recording feature to describe the bug verbally

#### 5. Generate Report

- Click the "Generate" button
- Our AI will analyze your recording and description
- A structured bug report will be created automatically

<Note>
  The bug report generation process combines your input with AI analysis of the
  recording to create comprehensive, reproducible bug reports.
